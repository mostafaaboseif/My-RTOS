# My-RTOS

This screenshot shows the simulation of My RTOS using PicoScope. It shows the difference between a simple round-robin scheduler and my priority-based scheduler. As we see here for Task 1, My RTOS gives it the highest priority so that it is not interrupted until it finishes, unlike the round-robin scheduler.

Thanks to Quantum Leaps, LLC for the course
